# Sinatra Ready to Go

This project has everything you need to begin adding controllers for a RESTful API.

## Setup and Installation

1. Run `bundle install` (you may have to run `gem install bundler` first)
2. Migrate the database by running `rake db:migrate`
3. Run `rerun rackup` to start the app...

But first you need to create controllers, routes, and map them.
